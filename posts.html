          <h2>Public Cloud is way ahead of the ability to secure it</h2>
            <i>November 30th 2020</i><br><br> 
            <p>As companies need to build applications to cater for distributed workforces, the use of public cloud is a no-brainer, but as the parade of companies failing to secure S3 buckets shows, cloud customers are failing to secure it properly.</p>
            <article>
              <i>"What we've seen across the board is most customers consumption of public cloud is way ahead of their ability to secure it, Barracuda senior vice president of data protection, network and application security Tim Jefferson told ZDNet."</i>
            </article>
            <p>As the shift to working from home at the start of the year began, the old reliance on the VPN showed itself to be a potential bottleneck to employees being able to do what they are paid for.</p>
            <p>Another effect from needing to handle a dispersed workforce has been the collapse of what was formerly a fairly-well defined corporate network perimeter.</p>
            <p>According to Jefferson, the new best practice is to push security controls as far out to the edge as possible, which undermines the role of traditional appliances like firewalls to be able to enforce security, and people are having to work out the best place for their controls in the new working environment.</p><br>
