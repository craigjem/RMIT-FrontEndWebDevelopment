          <h2>Beware of this sneaky phishing technique now being used in more attacks</h2>
            <i>January 16, 2020</i><br><br> 
            <p>There's been a large rise in cyber criminals using a particular phishing technique to trick workers into unwittingly installing malware, transferring money or handing over their login credentials.</p>

              <i>"There's been a large rise in cyber criminals using a particular phishing technique to trick workers into unwittingly installing malware, transferring money or handing over their login credentials."</i>
            </article>
            <p>In conversation-hijacking attacks, hackers infiltrate real business email threads by exploiting previously compromised credentials –perhaps purchased on dark web forums, stolen or accessed via brute force attacks – before inserting themselves into the conversation in the guise of one of the group.</p>
            <p>The idea is that by using a real identity and by mimicking the language that person uses, the phishing attack will be viewed as coming from a trusted colleague and is thus much more likely to be successful.</p>
            <p>Cyber criminals are leaning hard on this attack technique as a means of compromising businesses, according to new research from Barracuda Networks. Analysis of 500,000 emails showed that conversation hijacking rose by over 400% between July and November last year.</p><br>
